# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page corporate website for Brainscribe Solutions LLP with a professional light blue and white theme, smooth scroll navigation, service cards, about section, and a contact form backed by a Motoko canister.

**Planned changes:**
- Sticky top navigation bar with brand name "Brainscribe Solutions LLP" and smooth-scroll links to Hero, Services, About Us, and Contact sections
- Hero section with full-width banner image, bold headline, supporting subheadline, and a CTA button linking to the Contact section
- Services section displaying six cards (Microsoft Technologies, Moodle LMS, Staffing, XDT, Azure/AWS Hosting, eLearning Design) each with an icon, title, and brief description in a responsive grid
- About Us section with professional company copy covering mission, expertise, and client commitment
- Contact section with a form (Name, Email, Subject, Message) that validates required fields, shows a success confirmation on submit, and persists data in the Motoko backend
- Consistent light blue and white color theme applied across navbar, hero, buttons, and section accents; clean modern typography throughout

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a polished single-page corporate site, learn about Brainscribe Solutions LLP's services, read about the company, and submit a contact inquiry that is saved to the backend.
